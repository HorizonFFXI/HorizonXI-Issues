# HorizonXI-Issues
This is for posting bugs during the Open-Beta Rebase testing stage for Horizon XI

## Rebase Testing
Please follow the below format when creating new issues so that you receive proper credit!
- Title
- Horizon Character Name
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected Result
- Extra Evidence
  - Screenshots, Videos, Logs, etc..
 
## Bugs Processing
- We will be processing from oldest to newest first when we classify/fix bugs.  This ensures that the original reporter of a bug is given the proper credit for points tracking.
- If your Bug Report is tagged with "Need More Information" you will need to respond with the requested information within a weeks time.  If no response is received, the issue will be closed out and no points will be awarded.
- Duplicate Bugs will be closed out and no points will be awarded for duplicates.
- Reports that do not include your character name will not earn you points! Don't forget to add your character name!

## Points System
Points will be given based on the following scale:
- Minor Bugs: 5 Points
  - Things that may come off as wrong, but doesn't greatly affect gameplay
  - Text Issues, Broken NPC Interactions, Wrong or Broken Mob Skills, etc..
- Major Bugs: 10 Points
  - Things that prevent gameplay or progression of missions or content unlocks
  - Broken Missions or Mission BCNMs, Things that trivialize encounters in unintended ways (Mob just stands there, etc..)
- Minor Exploit: 10 Points
  - Things that allow players to bypass or skip content that is not intended to be skipped.
  - Doors opening when they shouldn't, etc..
- Vendor Gil Exploit: 15 Points
  - This is often called a "print exploit" where you can buy an item from one NPC, and sell it to another NPC for a profit of any amount.
- Other Cheats/Exploits: 15 Points
  - These are more serious exploits where a player can gain some form of an advantage over other players by abusing said exploit.
- Duping Issues: 20 Points
  - This is any instance of where an item can be duplicated through any means without losing the original item.
- Major Exploits: 25 Points
  - This is reserved for high-impact exploits such as infinitely using a BCNM Orb, being able to skip missions, etc..
  - The impact of these types of bugs is extreme where it causes both economic damage and/or gives major advantages to the player.
 
## Rewards System
Rewards are still being decided on but will be done in Tiers.  Each character that earns enough points to reach a tier will be able to claim those rewards once the rebase is launched.
Point Tiers and Rewards will be announced as soon as they are available, so keep an eye on this page!
